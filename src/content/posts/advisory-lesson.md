For today's advisory lesson, Computer Club is offering a few resources to have a bit of fun -- at any skill level!

# You are new to programming

These resources are best for those that have no experience in CS or programming and want to see what it's about. Many of these resources do not require writing code by hand, and allow you to use "blocks" to create programs.

- Create a [flappy bird game](https://studio.code.org/flappy/1).
- Create a simple chat bot through a guided tutorial in block-coding-like interface. Create an account through the login button [here](https://pickcode.io/), then when in the Learn section (in the nav menu on the left side of the UI), you should see a "Getting Started with Chat" bubble on the right side. Click on this then follow the tutorial. 
- Create a game where you have to light a fire while fighting against the challenges of nature in prehistoric times [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#docs:/skillmap/sparks).
- [Learn python!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnove7K-ZQ&list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg)
- Create a star wars game through block code [here](https://studio.code.org/s/starwarsblocks?viewAs=Instructor).

# You have written Some Code

- Create custom music with sound files in python [here](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?curriculum=/en/v1/ch_HourOfCode:WhatIs&language=python)
- Follow along in [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/classification.ipynb) (part of [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)) to create a machine learning model able to determine the name of fashion items from an image. You won't need to write any code! just press play on the code boxes and read through the comments to create and test the model.

If any of those activities were appealing to you, or you are interested in Competitive Programming, Open Source Software, Games Development, App Development, Artificial Intelligence, ... [join computer club](/signup)! We love new members.
