For today's advisory lesson, the BHS Computer Club is showing everyone some resources to further explore computer science and programming. We have split the resources into a few different categories, so you can find the resources that are best for you.

Have fun!!!

# What even is computer science, and why should I care?
Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field, and includes topics such as programming, algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and more. Computer science is a very important field, and is becoming more and more important as technology becomes more and more prevalent in our lives. It is also a very fun field, and can be used to create all sorts of cool things, from games to apps to websites to robots to AI.

In case you're still not convinced, here are some resources that explain why computer science is important and why you should care about it.
- [Why Computer Science?](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/why-study-computer-science/)
- [What is Computer Science?](https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/why-study-computer-science/)

**In case you're STILL not convinced, you should know that you've read so far under this heading has been AI generated**. Everything after this is human content, we promise.

# You are new to programming

These resources are best for those that have no experience in CS or programming and want to see what it's about. Many of these resources do not require writing code by hand, and allow you to use "blocks" or some other [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)) to create programs.

- Create a [flappy bird game](https://studio.code.org/flappy/1) at Code.org.
- Create a simple chat bot through a guided tutorial in block-coding-like interface. Create an account through the login button [here](https://pickcode.io/), then when in the Learn section (in the nav menu on the left side of the UI), you should see a "Getting Started with Chat" bubble on the right side. Click on that bubble, then follow the tutorial. 
- Create a game where you have to light a fire while fighting against the challenges of nature in prehistoric times [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#docs:/skillmap/sparks).
- [Learn python!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnove7K-ZQ&list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg)
- Create a Star Wars game through block-based coding [here](https://studio.code.org/s/starwarsblocks?viewAs=Instructor).

# You've got some experience with programming

- Create custom music with sound files in Python [here](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?curriculum=/en/v1/ch_HourOfCode:WhatIs&language=python)
- Try some of the the tricky coding problems over at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) or [cses.fi](https://cses.fi/problemset/). 
- Learn about and make an account on [GitHub](github.com), a website for hosting code and collaborating on projects. Here are some resources: [Computer Club Resouce](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjwX22HFLTa3FUJjDWL_bdxRclsfvCc-STh0kacKaso/edit), [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/), [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/), [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en), [GitHub YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides). You could even follow [this tutorial](blog-contributing) and publish a post on this website!
- Learn about [Open Source Software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) and [Open Source Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).

If any of these activities were appealing to you, or if you're interested in things like computer science, coding, competitive programming, game or app development, artificial intelligence, data science, or anything similar... [join computer club](/signup)! We love having new members.
