## Intermediate

 - Find an issue on an open source project on Github and try to solve it. There are some issues that are marked as "good for beginners" which can be a great way to get into open source. A good place to start looking for projects is by the language you are familiar with, or if you have used the software before
 - Learn NextJS and create a nextjs web app. https://codedamn.com/news/nextjs/top-10-project-ideas
 - Learn Unity and create a simple Unity game; There are many unity tutorials you can find online; pick one that interests you
 - Learn SQL and build a full stack app; 
     * I recommend using Supabase; here is a tutorial where you will learn to build a supabase based web app: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs . After you go though this, you and your team member can modify the app; A todo list is a popular idea
 - Any other idea that you or your partners have
 - Build a personal blog using anyweb technologies (I like both https://astro.build/ and nextjs)
