If you'd like to contribute to this blog, follow these steps. Anything in **bold** is a link that can be clicked on.

1. Make a **[GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)** if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the repository for this website **[here](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/BarringtonComputerClubWebsite)**.
3. **[Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)**.
4. On your own copy, click the green *Code* button and go to the *Codespaces* tab.
5. Create a new codespace.
6. In the codespace, you should be able to edit all the website files. Navigate to `./src/content/posts` and create a new file with the extension `.md`. Before you begin writing, copy and paste an old entry so you get all the frontmatter required.
7. When you're done writing, commit your changes by typing `git add . && git commit -m "create new blog post"` in the terminal.
8. Push your changes to your fork by typing `git push` into the terminal.
9. **[Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)** so we can review your changes!
