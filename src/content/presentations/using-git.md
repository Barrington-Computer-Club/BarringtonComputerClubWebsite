background: Github is the platform used to house thousands of open source software project. Everything thing is free, and all of the source for is available to see and modify. Contributors make pull requests to these repositories, and, if approved, will see their changes propagate to potentially thousands of users. I, for example, have made contributions to Lichess, and it is used by millions of people per months. In this presentation, we will learn exactly how to make these contributions.
